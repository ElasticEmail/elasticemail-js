# Delete List

This guide will walk you through steps of removing contacts list from your account using the NodeJS library. 

*Required Access Level: ModifyContacts*

## What's a list?
When using Elastic Email, you send emails to contacts â€“ recipients who receive your emails. Contacts can be grouped by created segments or lists. Segments add contacts automatically when specfied conditions are met, and contacts on lists are managed manually.

## Preparation
It's NodeJS code, so make sure you have it installed or download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Create a new JavaScript file `snippet.js` and open it in editor of your preference eg. Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Let's dig into the code

Put the below code to your file.

Load library using below line:

```javascript
const ElasticEmail = require('@elasticemail/elasticemail-client');
```

Get client instance:

```javascript
const client = ElasticEmail.ApiClient.instance;
```

Generate and use your API key (remember to check a required access level): 

```javascript
const apikey = client.authentications['apikey'];
apikey.apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```

Create an instance of ListsApi that will be used to delete a list.

```javascript
const listsApi = new ElasticEmail.ListsApi();
```

The only thing needed is a list name.

```javascript
const listName = 'Best contacts';
```

Create a callback function that will be called when response comes back.

In case of error it will display error details, otherwise it will display a success messages.

```javascript
const callback = (error, data, response) => {
    if (error) {
        console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log('API called successfully.');
        console.log('List deleted');
    }
};
```

And finally, call `listsByNameDelete` method from the API to delete a list: 

```javascript
listsApi.listsByNameDelete(listName, callback);
```


## The whole code to copy and paste:

```javascript
const ElasticEmail = require('@elasticemail/elasticemail-client');

const client = ElasticEmail.ApiClient.instance;

const apikey = client.authentications['apikey'];
apikey.apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";

const listsApi = new ElasticEmail.ListsApi();
const listName = 'Best contacts';

const callback = (error, data, response) => {
    if (error) {
        console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log('API called successfully.');
        console.log('List deleted');
    }
};
listsApi.listsByNameDelete(listName, callback);
```

## Run the code
```
node snippet.js
```
